For all people who want to get the most from their GoPro footage using Kdenlive

With this Effect Stacks I try to give good ideas on how to set up Kdenlive to get good results from your GoPro footage.

A personal note: After I watched my very first footage I was a kind of disappointed, because the sharpness, saturation, contrast, ... was far away from the quality shown in the official GoPro videos. So I decided to work on this problem.  

## Installation
* Copy the downloaded .xml files to ~/.kde/share/apps/kdenlive/effects
* If the folder effects doesn't exist create it

## My Setup
* GoPro Hero 3 Silver
* Ubuntu 12.04 native apt-get version of Kdenlive
* Due to problems with speed-effect (slowing down) I am working with v.0.9.7
